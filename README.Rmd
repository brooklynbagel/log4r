# log4r [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/johnmyleswhite/log4r.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/johnmyleswhite/log4r) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/johnmyleswhite/log4r?branch=master)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/johnmyleswhite/log4r)

## Introduction

The log4r package is meant to provide a clean, lightweight object-oriented
approach to logging in R based roughly on the widely-emulated log4j API.

## Installation

- Stable CRAN version:

```r
install.packages("log4r")
```

- Development version on GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("johnmyleswhite/log4r")
```

## Usage

Logging is configured by passing around `logger` objects created by `logger()`.
By default, this will log to the console and suppress messages below the
`"INFO"` level:

```{r basic-example}
logger <- logger()

info(logger, "Located nearest gas station.")
warn(logger, "Ez-Gas sensor network is not available.")
debug(logger, "Debug messages are suppressed by default.")
```

Logging destinations are controlled by **Appenders**, a few of which are
provided by the package. For instance, if we want to debug-level messages to a
file:

```{r file-example, echo = 1:7}
log_file <- tempfile()
logger <- logger("DEBUG", appenders = file_appender(log_file))

info(logger, "Messages are now written to the file instead.")
debug(logger, "Debug messages are now visible.")

readLines(log_file)
unlink(log_file)
```

The `appenders` parameter takes a list, so you can log to multiple destinations
transparently.

To control the format of the messages you can change the **Layout** used by
each appender. Layouts are functions; you can write your own quite easily:

```{r layout-example}
my_layout <- function(level, ...) {
  paste0(format(Sys.time()), " [", level, "] ", ..., collapse = "")
}

logger <- logger(appenders = console_appender(my_layout))
info(logger, "Messages should now look a little different.")
```

## Older APIs

The 0.2 API is still supported:

```{r old-api, echo = 1:12}
logger <- create.logger()

logfile(logger) <- log_file
level(logger) <- "INFO"

debug(logger, 'A Debugging Message')
info(logger, 'An Info Message')
warn(logger, 'A Warning Message')
error(logger, 'An Error Message')
fatal(logger, 'A Fatal Error Message')

readLines(log_file)
unlink(log_file)
```

## The log4r Priority Levels

`log4r` supports five priority levels. In order from lowest to highest
priority, they are:

* `"DEBUG"`
* `"INFO"`
* `"WARN"`
* `"ERROR"`
* `"FATAL"`

## Keep in Mind

* Use a log file in a non-existent directory will fail. In general, no effort
  is made to create directories.

* Only messages at or above the current threshold are logged. Messages below
  this level are simply ignored.

* Using the internal priority level constants using the `:::` notation is
  deprecated, but no warning is given.  It is safer to simply use strings
  or numeric constants.
